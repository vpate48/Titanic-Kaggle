Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic using two different approaches. The Titanic dataset is a classic machine learning problem often used for educational purposes and serves as an excellent opportunity to explore different modeling techniques.

1. Approach 1: Random Forest Classifier (Vanilla Python)
Description: The first approach utilizes a Random Forest Classifier implemented with vanilla Python and Scikit-learn. It preprocesses the data using basic techniques and trains the model to predict survival outcomes based on features like passenger class, sex, age, siblings/spouses, and parents/children aboard.

submission_vanilla.csv: CSV file containing predictions generated by the model.
2. Approach 2: Fastai TabularPandas (Fastai Library)
Description: The second approach leverages the Fastai library, which offers high-level abstractions for deep learning and structured data modeling. It employs Fastai's TabularPandas class to preprocess the data and trains a Random Forest Classifier using Fastai's API.
Files:

submission_fastai.csv: CSV file containing predictions generated by the Fastai-based model.
Data Files:
train.csv: Training dataset containing information about passengers.
test.csv: Test dataset for which survival outcomes need to be predicted.
gender_submission.csv: Sample submission file with passenger IDs and placeholder survival predictions.

Conclusion:
These approaches demonstrate two different methodologies for solving the Titanic survival prediction problem. While the first approach showcases traditional machine learning techniques using Scikit-learn, the second approach highlights the power and simplicity of Fastai's deep learning framework for structured data tasks. Users can compare the performance and implementation details of both approaches to gain insights into their strengths and limitations.
